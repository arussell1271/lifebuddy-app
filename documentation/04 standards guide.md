## Development Standards and Architecture (Version 2.0)

### Purpose

The **"Rules."** Ensures consistency in style, naming, architecture, and, most critically, **security** across the two decoupled services.

### What to Include

1. Naming Conventions.
2. The V2 Folder Structure (Body and Brain services).
3. The V2 Architectural Decisions (Service Separation, PoLP, Network Isolation).
4. Data Integrity, RLS, and Security Mandates.

***

### 1. Naming Conventions

| Element | Convention | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Python Variables/Functions | `snake_case` | `calculate_adherence_rate` |
| Python Classes/Models | `PascalCase` | `User`, `ActionableItemModel` |
| Database Tables/Columns | `snake_case` | `adherence_log`, `hashed_password` |
| API Endpoints (URL Paths) | `kebab-case` | `/api/v1/action-items` |
| Constants/Enums | `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` | `ITEM_TYPE_HOLISTIC` |

***

### 2. Code Structure (V2 High-Level Architecture)

The codebase is split into two distinct, network-isolated services: the public-facing **Application (The Body)** and the proprietary **Cognitive Engine (The Brain)**.

/ ├── app/ # Application Service (The Body) - Public-facing APIs │
  ├── api/ # Public FastAPI router definitions (endpoints) │
  ├── models/ # Pydantic models (DTOs) │
  ├── services/ # Business logic for CRUD (e.g., UserService, AdherenceService) │
  └── main.py # Entry point for the Body service
  ├── engine/ # Cognitive Engine Service (The Brain) - Proprietary Logic │
  ├── api/ # Internal FastAPI router definitions (The Brain's API) │
  ├── core/ # Core proprietary AI/LLM logic (H1, H2, H3) │
  ├── workers/ # Background/scheduled tasks (e.g., vectorization) │
  └── main.py # Entry point for the Brain service
  ├── db/ # Database files │
  ├── 03 db_schema.sql # Database DDL, RLS policies │
  └── init.sql # Postgres startup scripts (user creation, extensions)
  ├── .env.dev # Environment vars for development
  ├── .env.cognitive # SECURE environment vars for THE BRAIN
  └── docker-compose.yml # Defines the V2 services and networks

***

### 3. Architectural Decisions (V2 Separation & PoLP)

All logic must adhere to the **Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)** enforced by the V2 architecture.

#### A. Service Responsibilities

| Service | Responsibility | Database User Privilege | Network Access |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Application (The Body)** | User Authentication, CRUD operations on `actionable_items` and `adherence_log`, serving the UI. | `lifebuddy_rw` (Read/Write to standard tables). **CANNOT read `document_vectors`**. | `frontend-network` (Public/External). |

| **Cognitive Engine (The Brain)** | All proprietary logic: Vectorization, RAG, Cognitive Synthesis (H1, H2, H3), Item Generation. | `cognitive_engine_full` (Full access to all tables, including `document_vectors`). | `core-network` (Private/Internal). |

#### B. Inter-Service Communication

* The **Body** communicates with the **Brain** only via a dedicated, authenticated **Internal API**.
* All communication to the Brain must include the required `INTERNAL_API_KEY` for service-to-service authentication.

***

### 4. Data Integrity and Privacy

#### A. Row-Level Security (RLS) Mandate

**CRITICAL MANDATE: All tables containing user-specific data (e.g., `documents`, `health_metrics`, `adherence_log`) MUST have RLS policies enabled, ensuring that data is only visible under the following two conditions:**

1. **Primary User Access:** The `current_user_id` context equals the `row.user_id`. (The default and perpetual rule).
2. **Secondary User Access (NEW):** The `current_user_id` must be found as a `professional_user_id` in the **`data_access_grants`** table, and the corresponding grant must be **active (`revoked_at` IS NULL)** and its **`access_scope` JSONB field must permit the viewing of the specific data type being queried.**

This two-factor RLS check is the single, non-negotiable security layer for all collaborative features.

#### B. Logic Location

* **Core Business Logic:** All non-security-critical logic remains in the Python **Service Layer** of The Body or The Brain.
* **Security Logic:** All user isolation logic (RLS policies) **MUST** reside in the PostgreSQL layer.

#### C. Encryption Strategy

* **In Transit:** All API communication (internal and external) must be secured (HTTPS/TLS).
* **At Rest:** The entire PostgreSQL instance must be secured with a robust encryption strategy (e.g., TDE or file-system level encryption).
* **Vector Store:** The `document_vectors` table is secured by the combination of network isolation, a high-privilege user (`cognitive_engine_full`), and mandatory **RLS**.

### D. Data Retention Standard 📅

The principle of **Minimal Necessary Data** mandates strict retention limits for high-volume, short-term data structures.

| Component | Standard | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Cognitive State** (`user_cognitive_state` table) | **4-Day Rolling Window (Retention: 4 Days)** | Required data for short-term contextual synthesis (e.g., assessing mindset change). Retaining 4 days provides a safe buffer while minimizing storage. |
| **Enforcement Method** | **Scheduled Database Maintenance** | Enforced by a nightly, privileged `cron` job that executes a stored procedure (e.g., `db_maintenance_purge_old_state()`). |

### 5. Documentation Scoping Standard

All project documentation must strictly adhere to the Principle of Documentation Separation:

#### A. The Technical/Functional Barrier (Mandatory)

* **Functional Documents** (`05 functionality guide.md`, etc.): **MUST ONLY** use business and functional terms (e.g., "User Identity Store," "Actionable Item," "Cognitive Synthesis"). These documents **MUST NEVER** reference technical implementation details (e.g., table names like `users`, `actionable_items`; API routes like `/api/v1/health-metrics`; or service names like `Engine Service`).
* **Technical Documents** (`06 ui technical specifications.md`, etc.): **MUST** define the explicit mapping from functional terms to implementation details (e.g., mapping "User Identity Store" to the `users` table).
