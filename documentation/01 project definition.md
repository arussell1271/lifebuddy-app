## The Holistic Cognitive Data Engine ("Life Buddy")

**File Path:** 01 project definition.md
**Audience:** Stakeholders, Product Leadership, All Team Members (for philosophical alignment).

---

### Purpose

The **"Why"** and **"What."** This document defines the core business rules, the philosophical foundation, and the high-level goals of the project.

---

### I. Overall Goal (The Why)

To develop a scalable web and mobile application that implements the **Cultivate → Execute → Contribute** framework. This system integrates unconscious data with clinical health data to create a novel model for personalized, proactive patient care and community impact research.

### II. Target User/Audience

| Category | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Users** | Individuals committed to sustained behavioral change and health improvement. |
| **Secondary Users** | Linked Medical Professionals (e.g., "Dr. FRANK"), Mentors/Coaches, and Research Entities (with explicit user consent). |

### III. Core Philosophical Foundation: Cultivate → Execute → Contribute

Sustained behavioral change is dependent on aligning one's internal self-image with desired actions and measurable, impactful results.

| Phase | Data Focus | System Functionality |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CULTIVATE** | Unconscious Identity / Spiritual Alignment | Dream Analysis, Journaling, Spiritual Aspects. Identifies limiting subconscious misalignment. |
| **EXECUTE** | Action & Habit Tracking | Introduction of **Holistic Actionable Items** (linked to identity) derived from Cognitive synthesis. |
| **CONTRIBUTE** | Outcome & Metric Tracking | Improved health data (RHR, Sleep Score, Blood Results) and high adherence rates that contribute to the user's overall wellbeing. |

### IV. Key Hypotheses (Guiding Principles for Cognitive Logic)

These principles must be the foundation for all **Engine (Brain)** logic:

* **H1 (EXECUTE Quality):** Adherence to Holistic (Identity-Focused) Items will result in a more sustainable improvement in health markers than Mandated (Action-Focused) Items alone.
* **H2 (CULTIVATE Insight):** Frequency/theme of Unconscious/Spiritual Disalignment (Cultivate Data) will reliably predict Mandated Item non-adherence 3-5 days in advance.
* **H3 (CONTRIBUTION Metric):** The Cognitive Engine's ability to provide a real-time, personalized **Cultivate → Execute → Contribution** path will result in significantly higher overall adherence rates (80%) compared to standard digital health tools.
